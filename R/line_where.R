#' Identify an individual line in a sequence of commands
#'
#' The tests are written in terms of pronouns
#' - F the function at the highest level (but with assignment removed)
#' - Z the name being bound to the line's value by assignment. ("" if no assignment.)
#' - V the value produced by the line.
#' - E the expression itself (but with assignment removed)

#' @param ex a `"checkr_test"` object for instance as made by for_checkr()
#' @param ... passif/failif/insist tests specifying the kind of line we want. The messages associated with
#' each test can have moustaches written in terms of F, Z, V, or E.
#' @param message A character string message to give if no acceptable line is found.
#'
#' @details Testing starts with the first test in `...`. Each test, in turn, can produce a definitive pass or fail result, at which point
#' testing is complete. But tests can also produce indefinite results, in which case testing moves on to the next test (if any).
#' If there is not a definitive result from the tests, the return
#'
#' If `passif()` or `failif()` are used and the test is `TRUE`, no further testing is performed. Similarly,
#' if `insist()` is used and the test is `FALSE`, no further testing is performed. If none of these conditions
#' applies, `line_where()` progresses to the next of the tests in `...`. If none of the tests produce a definitive
#' result, `line_where()` will return an OK result.
#'
#' The `ex` argument is a `"checkr_test"` object. If that input object is a fail, `line_where()` immediately returns
#' that input: none of the tests are performed. This allows test results to be cascaded.
#'
#' Some important details about what types of objects F, Z, V, and E will be. V and E are straightforward: V will
#' always be the kinds of thing computed by the line, e.g. a vector, dataframe, and so on. E will always be
#' a language expression (minus the assignment, if any). But F and Z are names and character strings respectively.
#'
#' 1. `x <- sin(y^2)`, F will be a *name*, in this case, `as.name("sin")`. Z will be a character string, that is `"x"`. Keep in mind that
#' the R expression `sin` does not produce a name, it produces a value which happens to be the function that calculates sines.
#' 2. `y <- 1:4; y[3] <- y[2]`, F will again be a *name*, because indexing is a function call in R.
#' (In this example, the name is `as.name("[")`.) Z will again be a character string, in this case `"y[3]"`. You might
#' think it should be a call, because `quote(y[3])` is a call. But whatever is to the left of `<-` gets turned into a character
#' string.
#'
#'
#'
#' @return A `"checkr_test"` result which is either a pass, fail, or OK.
