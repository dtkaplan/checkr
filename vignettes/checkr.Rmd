Computer tutorials are systems for guiding the interaction between the student and the computer. In a typical tutorial exercise, the student is presented with a task and asked to modify or construct computer commands to carry out the task. Several things are accomplished by tutorial systems such as the RStudio's `learnr` system, the `swirl` package, or DataCamp's browser-based GUI and `testwhat` package:

1. Integrating explanatory narrative with exercises.
2. Establishing a path through the narrative and exercises that can be covered at a pace set by the student.
3. Providing a sandbox in which the student can safely evaluate commands. 
4. Examining student command submissions to determine whether the exercise task has been appropriately completed, and, if it has not, provide hints to guide the student.
5. Store a record of student progress through tutorials.

The `checkr` package supports a facility for (4) that can be integrated into tutorial systems such as `learnr`. It is hoped that `checkr` will enable instructors to write exercises that engage in a learning dialog with students, a dialog that can approximate the natural interaction between instructor and student that occurs when watching a student construct computer commands.

## The `checkr` framework

An instructor uses `checkr` by writing a custom checking function that takes computer code as input, analyzes that code, and depending on what it finds generates a pass-or-fail output containing a message that ideally is relevant and useful to the student. Let's look at the components of the description in the previous sentence.

- "computer code as input" -- The computer code is in the form of text generated by the student.
- "analyzes that code" -- To analyze is to "take apart." The computer code consists of one or more commands (which I'll call "lines of code"). Functions in the `checkr` package can separate the code into components according to patterns specified by the instructor. A simple pattern, for instance, is whether the line invokes some specified function such as `plot()`.
- "depending on what it finds" -- Once a relevant component of code has been isolated, tests can be performed on the elements of that component. Each such test can be associated with a message and a pass/fail/ok result. The custom function assembles the results from the various code components and integrates them into a single, overall result.
- "relevant and useful" -- The instructor, in writing the checking function, can check the submitted code into it's components at any level of detail and provide context-sensitive feedback regarding problems with specific components.

### A rich example

Suppose the task set for the student is:

> **Exercise 1**: Construct an appropriate linear regression model of the `mpg` of cars in the `mtcars` data set. Your model should have an R-squared of at least 0.30.

It's up to the instructor to decide how finely to look at the student's submission. Suppose you have decided to check:

a. Is the `lm()` function being used?
b. Is `mtcars` the data argument to `lm()`?
c. Is `mpg` on the left-hand side of the formula argument to `lm()`?
d. Is the R-squared at least 0.30?

Consider several possible student submissions:
```{r}
s1 <- "lm(mpg ~ hp, data = mtcars)" # Right!
s1wrong <- "lm(mpg ~ hp, data = head(mtcars))"
s2 <- "mod <- lm(mpg ~ hp, data = mtcars); summary(mod)" # Right!
s2wrong <- "mod <- lm(hp ~ mpg, data = mtcars); summary(mod)"
s3wrong <- "for_me <- mtcars; mosaic::rsquared(lm(data = for_me, mpg ~ 1))"
```

Some of these are right and some are wrong. (`s2wrong` will produce a model with a passing R-squared, but it's a model of `hp` rather than `mpg`. `s3wrong` has a model formula that cannot produce any R-squared but zero.) The commands have different structures. In `s1`, even though it's a satisfactory model, the R-squared is not calculated at all. (Perhaps the student "cleaned up" their code before submitting.) 

One pedagogical choice would be to insist that the student submission follow a specific template. The pedagogical choice I'll make here is to focus on the model itself and accept variant forms of the submission so long as they make a model with the specified qualities. 

The `checkr` package provides a means to implement your pedagogical choices. To illustrate, consider the function `check_exer_1()` defined below. `Check_exer_1()` uses several `checkr` functions that have not yet been explained, so on a first reading it will be hard to make sense of. Still, it may give you a general impression.

```{r echo = FALSE}
check_exer_1 <- function(USER_CODE) {
  code <- for_checkr(USER_CODE) # pre-processing
  lm_line <- line_calling(code, lm, message = "Use lm() to construct the model.")
  lm_call <- arg_calling(lm_line, lm)
  t1 <- data_arg(lm_call, 
                 insist(identical(V, mtcars), 
                        "Your data argument {{E}} was not `mtcars`."),
                 message = "You didn't supply a `data = ` argument to `lm()`.")
  if (failed(t1)) return(t1)
  f <- formula_arg(lm_call,
                  message = "You didn't give a formula specifying the structure of the model.")
  t2 <- check(f, insist(two_sided(f), "There's no response variable in your formula."))
  t2 <- check(t2, insist(rlang::f_lhs(E) == as.name("mpg"), 
                   paste("You need to have the miles-per-gallon variable",
                         "on the left side of the model formula.",
                         "You've got {{rlang::f_lhs(V)}} instead.")))
  if (failed(t2)) return(t2)
  check(lm_call, 
        insist(summary(V)$r.squared > 0.3, 
        "Your R-squared is {{summary(V)$r.squared}}. That's too small."),
        passif(TRUE, "Great job!"))
}
```

```{r echo = FALSE, comment = ""}
print_function_contents(check_exer_1, just_the_body = FALSE)
```

`Checkr` provides functions like `line_calling()`, `formula_arg()`, `data_arg()`, `insist()`, and `check()`.

Evaluating the various test cases of submissions with the `check_exer_1()` function shows how relevant and useful feedback can be given while largely disregarding coding style. 

```{r}
check_exer_1(s1)
check_exer_1(s1wrong)
check_exer_1(s2)
check_exer_1(s2wrong)
check_exer_1(s3wrong)
```

The printed form of the result includes whether the submission passed or failed, a congratulatory or diagnostic message, and the component of the code being checked at the point where the test passed or failed. When integrated with a tutorial system such as `learnr`, the `checkr` result is formatted as appropriate for that user interface. (For instance the code component is mainly of interest to the author of checking functions, not the student.)

## A range of approaches

Ultimately, it's up to the instructor to decide how much flexibility to give the student and how much to guide the student. To illustrate some possibilities, consider this task:

> **Exercise 2**: Use the `rep()` function, with `1:4` as an input, to generate the 12-element vector `1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4`

The most flexibility comes by checking if the correct result was produced. You can check the value produced by a line with the pronoun `V` (for value). Like this:

```{r}
check_exer_1_v0 <- function(USER_CODE) {
  code <- for_checkr(USER_CODE)
  desired <- rep(1:4, each = 3)
  line_where(code, insist(all(V == desired), "Your vector is {{V}}. That is not the result asked for."))
}
```

This may be more flexbility than desired. Here's a cheating solution that passes:
```{r}
check_exer_1_v0("c(1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4)")
```

Another approach is to have in mind a specific command and check for exactly that. This provides little or no flexibility. For instance:

```{r}
check_exer_1_v1 <- function(USER_CODE) {
  code <- for_checkr(USER_CODE)
  line_binding(code, rep(1:4, each = 3), passif(TRUE, "Just what I wanted!"), 
               message = "Sorry. Not exactly what I was looking for.")
}
```

This won't be fooled by the cheating answer ...


```{r}
check_exer_1_v1("c(1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4)")
```

... and it will work with a command matching that specified, even allowing assignment or trivial white-space changes ...

```{r}
check_exer_1_v1("x <- rep(1:4,each=3); x")
```


But here are reasonable student submissions that won't pass the test:

```{r}
check_exer_1_v1("x <- 1:4; rep(x, each = 3)")
check_exer_1_v1("sort(rep(1:4, 3))")
```

The challenge is to identify what aspects of the submission we require, but not to overspecify the details. For instance, the exercise statement specifies using `rep()` and that one argument will be `1:4`. To test this:

```{r}
check_exer_1_v2 <- function(USER_CODE) {
  code <- for_checkr(USER_CODE)
  desired <- rep(1:4, each = 3)
  line_a <- line_calling(code, rep, message = "I'm not seeing where you used `rep()`.")
  t1 <- vector_arg(line_a, insist(all(V == 1:4), "Where did you use `1:4`?"))
  if (failed(t1)) return(t1)
  line_where(code, insist(all(V == desired), "Your vector is {{V}}. That is not the result asked for."))
}
```

```{r}
check_exer_1_v2("x <- 1:4; rep(x, each = 3)")
check_exer_1_v2("sort(rep(1:4, 3))")
```

If the point of the exercise is to have the student see that `rep()` has optional named arguments, perhaps you want to check if the line involving `rep()` also has an argument named `each`. 

```{r}
check_exer_1_v3 <- function(USER_CODE) {
  code <- for_checkr(USER_CODE)
  desired <- rep(1:4, each = 3)
  LineA <- line_calling(code, rep, message = "I'm not seeing where you used `rep()`.")
  t1 <- vector_arg(LineA, insist(all(V == 1:4), "Where did you use `1:4`?"))
  if (failed(t1)) return(t1)
  rep_call <- arg_calling(LineA, rep) # in case rep() is buried in another function application, e.g. 1 * rep()
  t2 <- named_arg(rep_call, "each", 
                  insist(V == 3, "Remember, you want 12 elements in the output made from the 4 elements in the input"), 
                  message = "See what use you can make of the `each` argument to rep().")
  if (failed(t2)) return(t2)
  line_where(code, insist(all(V == desired), "Your vector is {{V}}. That is not the result asked for."))
}
```

## Starting out

The point of `checkr` is to allow interactive tutorials, such as `learnr` documents, to provide adaptive feedback. To start, however, I recommend that you develop your checkr commands within an ordinary R script or Rmd file where it's easy to inspect intermediate results and debug. Once you have the commands working satisfactory, it's straightforward to move your checking code into the interactive tutorial document.

A reasonable process is ...

1. Write down a few examples of possible submissions and what sort of feedback you want to give for each.
2. Create a script file containing your examples. 
3. Put your checkr lines in a function that takes one argument: `USER_CODE`.
4. When you have all your examples working, integrate the function into your tutorial. For `learnr` documents, this amounts to creating a `-check` chunk in which you call your function with one argument: `USER_CODE`.

Let's illustrate this with a specific example problem.

> Read the data file `"http://www.lock5stat.com/datasets/HoneybeeCircuits.csv"` into a dataframe named `Circuits`.

### 1. Examples of possible submissions

```r
Circuits <- read.csv("http://www.lock5stat.com/datasets/HoneybeeCircuits.csv")
```
Response: Right!

```r
Circuits <- load("http://www.lock5stat.com/datasets/HoneybeeCircuits.csv")
```
Response: Notice that the filename has a CSV extension. `load()` is for reading RDA files. Try `read.csv()` instead.

```r
read.csv("http://www.lock5stat.com/datasets/HoneybeeCircuits.csv")
```
Response: Remember to store the contents of the data file under the name `Circuits`.

```r
bees <- read.csv("http://www.lock5stat.com/datasets/HoneybeeCircuits.csv")
```
Response: Store the data under the name `Circuits`, not `bees`.

Of course, there are many other possibilities. Students are particularly good at finding them.

### 2. Create a script file

Open up an R script file and add your example submissions. Let's suppose the file is named `check_bee_data.R`. It will look like this:
```{r}
# this is file check_bee_data.R
s1 <- quote(Circuits <- read.csv("http://www.lock5stat.com/datasets/HoneybeeCircuits.csv"))
s2 <- quote(Circuits <- load("http://www.lock5stat.com/datasets/HoneybeeCircuits.csv"))
s3 <- quote(read.csv("http://www.lock5stat.com/datasets/HoneybeeCircuits.csv"))
s4 <- quote(bees <- read.csv("http://www.lock5stat.com/datasets/HoneybeeCircuits.csv"))
```

The `quote()` function will be unfamiliar to many R users. It provides a way to objects that contain executable expressions.

### 3. Create the checking function

A checking function takes a submission, for example `s1` or `s2`, and returns a value indicating whether the submission passes or fails along with an appropriate congratulatory or explanatory message. The function has a straightforward skeleton.

```{r}
# also in the file check_bee_data.R
check_bee_data <- function(USER_CODE) {
  code <- for_checkr(USER_CODE)
  # The messages 
  m1 <- "Right!"
  m2 <- "Notice that the filename has a CSV extension. `load()` is for reading RDA files. Try `read.csv()` instead."
  m3 <- "Remember to store the contents of the data file under the name `Circuits`."
  m4 <- "Store the data under the name `Circuits`, not `{{Z}}`."
  
  # The checking statements will follow
  
}
```

The messages are plain text strings. I've named them (e.g. `m1`) purely for later convenience. Looking at `m4`, you'll notice the characters `{{Z}}`. Similarly, there's `{{F}}` in `m2`. Such "moustached" statements allow you to include in the message the result of some calculation. For `m4`, we want the assignment name used by the student. For `m2`, we want the name of the function actually used by the student.

At this point, you need to start thinking about the order in which you want to check the submission. For instance, do you want to check the function being used or that a correctly named object is being created? In this example, we'll start with the latter.

```{r}
# also in the file check_bee_data.R
check_bee_data <- function(USER_CODE) {
  code <- for_checkr(USER_CODE)
  # The messages 
  m1 <- "Right!"
  m2 <- "Notice that the filename has a CSV extension. `{{F}}` is for reading RDA files. Try `read.csv()` instead."
  m3 <- "Remember to store the contents of the data file under the name `Circuits`."
  m4 <- "Store the data under the name `Circuits`, not `{{Z}}`."
  
  browser()
  result <- line_where(code, 
                      passif(Z == "Circuits"), 
                      failif(Z == "", m3), 
                      failif(TRUE, m4))
  
  return(result) # return the result of the checking
}
```
To find out what the pronoun `Z` stands for, see the documentation for `line_where()`, or look later in this vignette. 


The `check_bee_data()` function does not yet fully implement the tests needed for the various submissions, but it is a working function that handles `s3` and `s4`. You need merely run the submissions through the function to see this:

```{r}
# just checking ...
check_bee_data(s3)
check_bee_data(s4)
```

Another checking statement is needed to make sure that the `read.csv()` function is being used. It could be as simple as this:

```{r eval = FALSE}
# this will go in the `check_bee_data()` function
result <- line_where(result, insist(F == read.csv, m2))
```

Unfortunately, things are not so simple. We intend message `m2` to be given in response to submission `s2`. But there's something special about `s2` as compared to the other submissions: `s2` generates a run-time error; `load()` is not set up to accept a character string URL as an argument. Such errors need to be trapped before the code is evaluated. We discuss the matter below in the section on re-evaluation checking.
 
### 4. Integrating the checking with `learnr`

Once you have your checking function in a reasonable state, you can integrate it with `learnr`. There are two components to this.

1. In the `setup` chunk of your tutorial 
    a. Tell `learnr` to connect to `checkr` with the statement 
        `tutorial_options(exercise.checker = checkr::check_for_learnr)`
    b. Source the script file where you define your checking function. Typically, such files need to be placed in the `www` subdirectory of your `learnr` application. The statement will look like this:
        `source("www/check_bee_data.R")`
2. Put the call to the function in the appropriate `-check` chunk for your exercise. The call must *always* use `USER_CODE` as the argument; this is the way the `learnr` exercise checker will set things up.
        



## checkr_result objects 

These are the input and output of many checkr functions. Your checkr statements should ultimately return one of these. These automatically get translated into the format that `learnr` wants by `check_for_learnr()`

## Some R background 

Most R users learn how to compute on dataframes, vectors, and so on. The `checkr` system involves something different: computing on the language itself. That is to say, the inputs to most `checkr` functions are language statements.

It will help you to use `checkr` if you learn something about the structure of the R language. Your students won't have to know this, but the checking code that you read and write will be easier to understand with this knowledge of language structure.

### Lines, functions, arguments, constants, names, values 

Consider this sequence of R commands:
```{r results = "hide"}
x <- 3 / 5
sqrt(x)
```

The code is written on three lines typographically, but it's also helpful to think about "lines" computationally. Informally, let's define a **line of code** to be a set of characters which, if typed at the command prompt in the console, would cause the R interpreter to perform a computation rather than to prompt you with the + continuation. For instance, the following code consists of just one computational line even though typographically it is spread out over three lines on the page:
```{r eval = FALSE}
paste("How now",
      color, animal, 
      "?")
```

Every line of R code consists of one or more expressions, each of which could constitute a complete command and thus could compute a **value**. In the line `x <- 3 / 5`, for example, you can see expressions `3` and `5`. As it happens, these two expressions are both **constants**. Another kind of constant is a character string: `"like this"`. In the line `sqrt(x)`, there is a simple expression, `x`, which is called a **name**. And, of course, there is a value assigned to the name `x` by the previous line. Other names in the examples are `sqrt`, and `` `\` ``. The values of those names were assigned by the R system itself during start-up. You can look at the value bound to any name by giving the name itself as a command:

```{r}
sqrt
```

Ignore for the moment the assignment part of the line; we'll treat that separately.

- Statement 1: Every line in R is either a single constant or a single name or a function call. 
- Statement 2: Every function call in R involves two parts: 1) the function itself (typically specified with a name, e.g. . `` `+` ``, `sqrt`, `paste`) and 2) the arguments to which the function is being applied.
- Statement 3: Every argument in a function call is either a single constant (e.g. `"How now"`) or a single name (e.g. `color`) or a function call.

Some of the functions in `checkr` are intended to isolate a specific line. Other functions isolate a function call or an argument to a function. Once isolated, you can check the name of the function involved in the function call, or the name (if any) or value (always) used as an argument.

PRACTICE IDENTIFYING the parts of a line as either a function call, a name, or a constant.


### Quote and quo

You're used thinking of functions as creating dataframes or vectors and so on. You may not have directly encountered them, but there are special functions that create an R-language expression itself. Examples are `substitute()`, `parse()`, `expression()`. To illustrate, consider the `quote()` function. (Don't be deceived: quote is not about creating character strings.) 

```{r}
y <- quote(foo(f, g))
```

A standard way to think about `foo(f, g)` is "perform the action of the function `foo()` on the two arguments: `f` and `g`. and then take the sine of the result." But in terms of the language, you can see four names: `f`, `g`, `foo`. There's also some punctuation: the parentheses that signal that `foo` is to be applied to its arguments and the comma that separates the two arguments.

Think about what might be the value bound to the name `y` after the above line is evaluated. And while you're doing it, assume that there is no defined function named `foo` and that no value has been yet bound to the names `f` and `g`. 

Ordinarily, referring to a valueless name like `f` generates an error: `Error: object 'f' not found`. But `quote()` is special. It doesn't try to evaluate its argument and so it has no need for names to be bound to values. So the object `y` is not about the results of `foo(f, g)` but about its status as a command that can be evaluated later on. Instead, `quote()` figures out from the syntax of its argument that `foo(f, g)` is a call to a function. (A name followed immediately by an opening parenthesis is *always* a function call.)

```{r}
y        # display printed form
class(y) # the object's class
```

The object `y` produced by `quote(foo(f, g))` is of class "call," reflecting that the expression given as an argument to `quote()` is a function call. The printed form of `y` looks just like the argument to `quote()`. But you can choose to look at `y` in another way, as a list:

```{r}
as.list(y)
```

The list starts with the function name, with the remaining parts being the two arguments. In this example, each of the three items in the list are names:
```{r}
lapply(y, class)
```

This list-like structure for a function call applies just as well to arithmetic and other *infix* functions. R allows you to create a call without using parentheses, for instance `2 + 3`. The internal storage of the expression is nonethess list-like. For instance:
```{r}
y <- quote(x ^ 2)
class(y)
as.list(y)
```

Do note the backticks around the name in the first element of the list: `` `^` ``. In general, when you are referring to functions used with infix notation, you need to construct the function name with backticks. Examples: `||`, `*`, `>`, and so on.

Let's consider a slightly more complex case, where the arguments themselves involve function calls:

```{r}
y <- quote(foo(f + 3, paste("Hello,", g, "Nice to meet you.")))
```

Again, `y` is a "call" and there are three parts to it: the function name and the two arguments:
```{r}
y
class(y)
as.list(y)
lapply(y, class)
```

Note that parts 2 and 3 of `y` are no longer `name`s. Instead, they are themselves function calls. To illustrate, let's look at the third part of the list.

```{r}
y[[3]]
class(y[[3]])
as.list(y[[3]])
lapply(y[[3]], class)
```


The call `paste("Hello", g, "Nice to meet you.")` is a call to the function named `paste` with three arguments. Two of these arguments are constants; they happen to be character constants. The middle argument, `g` is a name.

You can evaluate a name or a call by using the `eval()` function. Of course, evaluation needs values to be assigned to any names used, so evaluating `y` will throw an error:
```{r error = TRUE}
eval(y)
```

`Quote()` and `eval()` (and other similar language-handling functions like `substitute()` or even the modeler's tilde) are part of base R. They are part of how the language works. They are not part of an average user's R toolbox because average users are in the value business: applying functions to values, not taking apart the language. 

Still, many users encounter situations where they are using language objects rather than values. Take the `select()` function as used to pull out a subset of rows from a dataframe. You can use it like this:
```{r}
select(mtcars, hp > 250)
```

We can take apart the command:
```{r}
y <- quote(select(mtcars, hp > 250))
as.list(y)
lapply(y, class)
```

The first two parts of `y` are easy: `select` is a name and `mtcars` is a name. The third part is a call. The thing that's interesting about `select()` from a programming point of view is that the third part cannot be evaluated as is:
```{r error = TRUE}
eval(quote(hp > 250))
```
The name `hp` doesn't have a value. It only has meaning with respect to the `mtcars` dataframe. It's `select()` that contains the logic to connect `hp` to `mtcars`.

The `rlang` package provides facilities for taking apart calls and ensuring that the names used in a call are linked to the environment that gives them values. `Checkr` makes extensive use of `rlang`.

### Multiple statements within `quote()`

Often you will be working with submitted code with multiple statements. When using `quote()` to create examples with multiple statements, you need to enclose the statements with curly braces `{  }` and separate the statements with a semi-colon.  For instance:

```{r}
y <- quote({who <- "Alfred"; paste("Welcome,", who)})
y
```

### Assignment

Strictly speaking, an assignment statement is a function call involving two arguments. 
```{r}
y <- quote(x <- foo(f,g))
class(y)
as.list(y)
```
The function is called `` `<-` ``. The first argument is the name to to use for storing the value of the second argument. The second argument is the value (perhaps constructed by evaluating a call) to be stored under the name.

When using `checkr` on an assignment statement, the checking logic is performed on the expression to the right of the assignment symbol. As you'll see later, if it's important to your checking logic to know if assignment is involved, or what is the name being assigned to, you can write tests using the pronoun `Z`. Except for `Z`, there is no vestige of the assignment being used in the `checkr` tests.

## Preparing code for `checkr`

In previous examples, we've used `quote()` to store examples of submitted code. Another way to store code, the one used in `learnr`, is as a text string. `Checkr` can work with both. 

Before `checkr` tests can be applied to code, you need to pre-process the code. This is the task of the `for_checkr()` function.  For instance:
```{r}
s1 <- quote(Bees <- read.csv("bee_file.csv"))
code <- for_checkr(s1)
```

The value created by `for_checkr()` is an object of class `"checkr_result"`. This has the code (and other information) in a standard format. Many of the `checkr` functions take such an object as input and return the same kind of object as output. In this way, you can cascade your logic: first testing for one thing, then another, and so on.


## `Checkr` functions

This section introduces the most important functions for implementing a checking logic. You'll want to make sure you understand the following concepts:

- quoted code, as produced by `quote()`
- the distinction between an R expression and the *value* produced when evaluating that expression.
- names
- constants (numeric and character)
- function calls
- function arguments
- a "line" of code 

`Checkr` functions perform a variety of tasks:

1. Transforming code from one form to another
2. Associating tests with specific outcomes and messages
3. Locating lines in the code.
4. Locating arguments to a function call.
5. Combining results from different tests.

Let's examine these categories one by one.

### 1. Transforming code

* `for_checkr()` takes as input code quoted form or in the form of a character string. *Every* checking function will use `for_checkr()`. The output of `for_checkr()` is a `"checkr_result"` object, which contains one or more lines of code, as well as the test result and message.
* `expand_all_chains()` takes a `checkr_result` object as input and returns another `checkr_result` object where all `magrittr` chains in the code of the input object are split into sequences of lines. `expand_chain()` is similar, but works only on one line of code. You won't need these functions unless you are checking statements written in chaining notation.

## 2. Associating tests with specific outcomes and messages

A "test" in `checkr` is an R expression that returns `TRUE` or `FALSE`. Some examples of tests are `nrow(df) > 10` or `Z == Bees`. Depending on the result of a test, you may "pass" or "fail" the submitted code, typically providing a message congratulating on the "pass" or providing a hint about what went wrong in the case o "fail."

Three functions enable you to state what you want to have happen in the event of a pass or fail:

* `passif()`. The first argument is a test, the second a character-string message. If the test produces `TRUE`, you are saying that the code is successful. If the test if `FALSE`, nothing happens.
* `failif()`. Like `passif()`, but a `TRUE` test indicates that the code is rejected. If the test is `FALSE`, nothing happens.
* `insist()`. Again like `passif()` but with important differences. If the test is `FALSE`, the code is rejected and the message is used to indicate the reason for the rejection. If the test is `TRUE`, nothing happens.

You will use `passif()`, `failif()`, and `insist()` within other checking functions.

## 3. Locating lines in submitted code.

Submitted code consists of one or more lines of R code. (The submission can also be empty. See `if_empty_submission()`.)

You might think that 

* transform code: for_checkr, expand_all_chains, expand_chain
* locating lines
    - line_binding: Looking for something exactly matching a template 
    - line_calling, 
    - line_where,
    - line_chaining
* pronoun tests
    - passif, failif, insist
    - line_where

Trying this out ...

```{r}
check_exer_1_v3("x <- 1:4; rep(x, each = 3)")
check_exer_1_v3("sort(rep(1:4, 3))")
```


## Pre-evaluation checking

WHAT TO DO WHEN THERE IS A PARSE ERROR.

POSSIBILITIES WHEN THERE IS A RUN-TIME ERROR to anticipate particular situations.

## Why right is wrong.

It's not just the output. It's the way they went about producing the output.

HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO GRADE ESSAYS


One of the most powerful heuristics is Right-or-Wrong. The `checkr` package provides facilities to give some feedback on their work.

"Summative feedback," in the jargon of education, means telling whether the student was right or wrong; whether the submitted work satisfied the requirements. In computer programming, summative feedback can be based on whether a correct result was computed, whether a function works as required, and so on. `Checkr` provides simple mechanisms for comparing the quantities computed by the student submission to known values.

"Formative feedback" attempts to help the student develop a better submission. This is a more subtle situation, since good feedback must involve understanding of how student's think about the problem, typical patterns in student answers, and the variety of ways that the problem can be approached. `Checkr` provides facilities for looking within the student's code for functions and their arguments, for checking intermediate results, and to look for specific mistake patterns.

The `checkr` package provides such an evaluation system that provides both summative and formative feedback and, at the instructor's discretion, logs student submissions for assigning credit and to support looking for common patterns of misconception in student answers.

`Checkr` can be used in a stand-alone mode or as embedded in a `learnr` tutorial. 

## A catalog of functions

Process the submitted code to prepare for testing:

* `for_checkr(USER_CODE)` will take the code directly from `learnr`. Or, for development purposes, you can set `USER_CODE` yourself to be either a character string containing the code or a quoted line or set of lines. (The set of lines for `quote()` must be in curly braces.)
* `expand_chain(CODE)` once you've identified a line of interest that happens to be a chain, you may want to do checks within that line. `expand_chain(CODE)` turns the sequence of statements in a chain into individual statements, and provides a binding in each statement for the value of `.` that will be the input to that statement.
* `expend_all_chains(CODE)` takes a set of statements and expands all the chains in it, so that it can be treated as an ordinary sequence of statements.

Locate a line ...

* `line_where()` - binds V, E, Z, F. Special case of line_binding. passif(), insist(), failif() tests written in terms of V, EX, Z, F
* `line_calling()` - looks for a call to a function anywhere in the line. Compare: `line_where()` provides F, which is just the highest-level call. 
* `line_binding()` - custom bindings to patterns. Can use `failif()`, etc.

Within a line or expression...

* `call_to()`  Pulls out the expression in a line that is a call to a specified function.
* `test_binding()` Allows custom binding to an expression. (Just an alias for `line_binding()`)

Arguments. Each returns the argument as an expression, applying any tests

* `arg_calling()` return an argument that calls  a specified function
* `named_arg()` return an argument that has a specified name.
* `formula_arg()` return an argument that is a formula. Similar for `data_arg()`, `matrix_arg()`, `vector_arg()`, `list_arg()`, `table_arg()`, `first_arg()`
* `arg_number()` return the argument in position n

Tests that trigger a desired outcome

* `passif()`, `failif()`, `okif()`

Within tests ...

* `%same_as%`
* `%not_same_as%`


## A first example

Consider this problem from trigonometry:

> ![](trig-problem-1.png)    
> Write an R statement to compute the numerical value of x.

A mathematically correct answer is $15 \sin(53^\circ)$. The corresponding R command is `15 * sin(53 * pi / 180)`, where the conversion to radians of 53$^\circ$ is accomplished by multiplying by $\pi/180$.

In evaluating a student's submission for this problem, there are a number of things that the instructor might look for:

1. Is the numerical value of the result correct? Here, that would be about `r round(15 * sin(53*pi/180), 2)`. 

Of course, if the value computed by the student's submission is not correct, then we know the submission itself is not right. But we don't know *why* it's not right. Knowing why it's not right is important if we want to provide formative feedback to the student. In providing such formative feedback it would also be good to know:

2. Is the $\sin$ function being used? 
3. Is 53 the argument to $\sin$? If not, we can remind the student to convert the angle to radians.
4. Is multiplication by a conversion factor being used, and is the conversion factor correct?

Answering questions (2) through (4) requires that the student's submission be taken apart: what's the function and what's the argument to the function. `Checkr` provides a handful of functions that do this in different ways. 

### Submitting what?

In a tutorial system like `learnr`, the system itself does the work of collecting the student's submission and handing it off to the checking statements. `Checkr` is written so that it can be used both within a system like `learnr` and also in a stand-alone way. One advantage of this is that you can develop and test your checking statements systematically before deploying them in a tutorial. 

The document you are reading is a vignette, not a tutorial. To play the role of the tutorial system, in this tutorial we'll write student submissions as "quoted" commands. (We'll say more about `quote()` later on. It's an ordinary base R command, albeit one that few R users  encounter.)

```{r}
USER_CODE <- quote(y <- 15 * sin(53 * pi / 180))
```

The first task for `checkr` is to parse the submission. The `for_checkr()` function does this along with some additional processing for when there are multiple commands in the submission.
```{r}
CODE <- for_checkr(USER_CODE)
```

From now on, the character-string submission itself is not needed; all the necessary information is in `CODE`.

### Looking for a valid line

The student's submission might include blank lines, or some scratch work, or some setup that calculates some component of the answer. A good way to handle such diverse possibilities is to use the `at()` function to probe the submission for a line that contains the desired result.

To start very simply, let's look for a line that generates the expected numerical result:


```{r}
line_where(CODE, 
           insist(is.numeric(V)), 
           passif(abs(V - 11.98) < 0.01, "Good job!"), 
           message = "Wrong numerical result.")
```

The `line_where` function scans through all the lines in `CODE`. (There's just one line in this example.) For each line, `line_where()` creates some pronouns:

- `V` - the value of the line
- `F` - the top-level function used in the line
- `E` - the expression itself, as code.
- `Z` - the name to which the result was assigned, if any.

If the line contains an assignment, `F` and `E` both refer to the right-hand side of the assignment.

For each line in `CODE`, `line_where()` runs tests written in terms of the pronouns. These tests are written using the functions `passif()`, `failif()`, `insist()`. The first argument to these functions is an ordinary R statement written in terms of the pronouns and which returns a logical. The second argument (optional) is a message.  There can be multiple test statements (each as its own argument to `line_where()`, and so separated by commas as usual in R). 

* `passif()` - denotes a sufficient condition. This is a good place to put a success message.
* `failif()` - denotes a sufficient condition, but one that leads to a failure. The message should indicate the reason for the failure.
* `insist()` - denotes a necessary condition to pass, but not a sufficient one. If the test passes, go on to any following tests without note. The message here should indicate the reason for the failure, that is, what necessary condition was not satisfied.
* `noteif()` - neither necessary nor sufficient. This is merely a way of appending a note to the message that will eventually be returned by the other functions. The message will be that note.

If there is any line for which *none* of the tests fail, `line_where()` returns that line in a format that can be used for further testing, if desired. If there is no such line in `CODE`, `line_where()` will return a failure result.

The `type = is.numeric` argument to `at()` is a way of saying, "I'm only going to run the tests if `V` is numerical." This provides some armor against the possibility that the submission produces something other than a number.

### Connecting with `learnr`

It might be that all you want is to check that *some* line produces the result you're looking for. For this simple situation, you might implement the tutorial code checking in `learnr` by adding a `-check` block for the exercise with these contents:

NEED TO CHECK THIS IN LEARNR
```r
CODE <- for_checkr(USER_CODE)
line_where(CODE, 
passif(abs(V - 11.98) < 0.01, "{{V}} is indeed the right answer."), 
message = "Wrong numerical result.")
```

This is a very simplistic sort of feedback: right or wrong.

### Providing constructive feedback

Depending on your purpose, you may want to examine the submitted code for the kinds of errors you expect to be common and provide messages to guide the student around such errors. The following statements, for instance, check whether the user calls a trig function, uses multiplication, and gets the right value, all in the same line.

```{r}
CODE <- for_checkr(USER_CODE)
# CODE <- for_checkr(quote(11.98))
# CODE <- for_checkr(quote(sin(53)))
# CODE <- for_checkr(quote(15 * cos(53)))
t1 <- line_calling(CODE, sin, cos, tan, message = "You should be using a trigonometric function.")
t1 <- line_where(t1, insist(F == quote(`*`), "Remember to multiply by the length of the hypotenuse"))
line_where(t1, insist(is.numeric(V)), 
           passif(abs(V - 11.98) < 0.01, "Good!"), 
           message = "{{V}} is a wrong numerical result. It should be about 11.98.")
```

Note that the input to each `line_` function is the output of a previous function. The checking will stop on the first failure, so each line is run conditional on the previous lines passing. The commented out `CODE` fragments would trigger failures with different messages.

Later, we'll see how to have multiple chains exploring different possibilities. 

You could do further checking, if desired. For instance, before checking the final value, perhaps make sure that the sine function specifically is being called, or if the value produced by the sine function is consistent with 53 degrees. How much checking to do is a matter of the desired pedagogical style. 



### Anticipating student errors

When developing checking code, you likely have in mind some typical mistakes that a student might make. For instance, in trigonometry, it's common to confuse the cosine with the sine. You might want to include checking statements that look specifically for a particular mistake and give a tailored feedback message.

```{r}
CODE <- for_checkr(quote(15 * cos(53)))
t1 <- line_calling(CODE, sin, cos, tan, message = "You should be using a trigonometric function.")
t1 <- misconception(t1, line_calling(t1, cos), message = "Are you sure cosine is the right choice?")
t1 <- line_where(t1, 
                 insist(F == quote(`*`), 
                        "Remember to multiply by the length of the hypotenuse"))
line_where(t1, insist(is.numeric(V)), 
           insist(abs(V - 11.98) < 0.01, 
                  "{{V}} is a wrong numerical result. It should be about 11.98."))
```

### Testing chains

* If you insist that a particular statement be a chain, you can extract that statement with `line_chaining()`. Then use `expand_chain()` to turn that into a sequence of ordinary statements that can be checked in the ordinary way.
* By default, use `expand_all_chains()` to turn the code into a single sequence that expands all the chains.

So, if you're anticipating that a chain might be used and that you want to analyze the individual elements of that chain, thinking about using `expand_all_chains()` directly on the `CODE`.

A POSSIBLE EXAMPLE:


Sometimes the exercise is itself about constructing a chain. For instance:

> **Exercise 9**: Consider the following wrangling statement:
    ```r
res <- group_by(mtcars, cyl)
summarise(res, disp = mean(disp))
```
    Rewrite it as a chain.
    
The checking function needs to make sure the task is accomplished, like this:
```{r}
chk_exer_9 <- function(USER_CODE) {
  code <- for_checkr(USER_CODE)
  t1 <- line_chaining(code, message = "Remember, chains involve `%>%`.")
  check(t1, 
        insist(identical(V, mtcars %>% group_by(cyl) %>% summarise(disp = mean(disp))), "Your chain doesn't produce the right value."),
        passif(TRUE, "Great!"))
}
```

```{r}
chk_exer_9("mtcars %>% group_by(cyl) %>% summarise(disp = mean(disp))")
chk_exer_9("mtcars %>% group_by(hp) %>% summarise(disp = mean(disp))")
chk_exer_9("res <- group_by(mtcars, cyl); summarise(res, disp = mean(disp))")
```

### Writing functions for checking

The functions provided by `checkr` can be composed into higher-level functions in the ordinary way. We'll call these *`checkr` functions*.  Keep in mind: that both the input to and output from a `checkr` function should be an object of type `checkr_result`. (There can be other inputs as well, for instance, a specified value.)

To illustrate, consider `trig_radian_check()`, a function to check whether the argument to trigonometric functions is in radians. It takes as arguments a `checkr_result` that (presumably) contains a call to a trigonometric function and the value, in radians, that is expected.





Consider this checking statement:

```{r echo = FALSE}
CHECK <- function(submission) 
  if_matches(submission, .(fn)(..(ang)), 
             insist(fn == quote(sin), "{{fn}} is not the correct trig function."),
             failif(ang == 53, "You need to convert the 53 degrees into radians."),
             insist(ang == 53 * pi / 180, "Do you have the angle right?"),
             failif(TRUE, "Remember to take the length of the hypothenuse into account."))
```

```{r eval = FALSE}
if_matches(submission, .(fn)(..(ang)), 
           insist(fn == quote(sin), "{{fn}} is not the correct trig function."),
           failif(ang == 53, "You need to convert the 53 degrees into radians."),
           insist(ang == 53 * pi / 180, "Do you have the angle right?"),
           failif(TRUE, "Remember to take the length of the hypothenuse into account."))
```

The result, of course, depends on the submission. 

- If the submission is `15 * sin(53 * pi / 180)`, we don't want the submission to fail. For that submission, the result of the above `if_matches()` will be
```{r eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
CHECK(quote(15*sin(53 * pi/180)))
```
The submission fails to match the pattern `.(fn)(..(ang))` because that pattern doesn't incorporate the "multiply by 15" in the submission.

- If the submission is `sin(53 * pi / 180)`, we do want the submission to fail. But it's helpful if the failure message points out what the problem is, namely the failure to multiply by 15. For this submission, the result of the check statement will be
```{r eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
CHECK(quote(sin(53 * pi/180)))
```
- If the submission is `cos(53 * pi / 180)`, the failure should indicate that cosine is the wrong trig function.
```{r eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
CHECK(quote(cos(53 * pi / 180)))
```
- If the submission is `sin(53)`, the failure should be about using degrees as the argument:
```{r eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
CHECK(quote(sin(53)))
```

A more complete answer would look for multiplication by 15. This involves a pattern something like: `15 * .(fn)(..(arg))`. But, since we think a common student error will be to leave out the `15 *`, we'll want to check as well for a match to plain `.(fn)(..(arg))`. When there are multiple, structurally different patterns, use multiple `if_matches()` statements, like this:

```{r eval = FALSE}
if_matches(submission, .(fn)(..(arg)), 
           failif(TRUE, "Remember to take the length of the hypothenuse into account."))
if_matches(submission, 15 * .(fn)(..(arg)), 
           insist(fn == quote(sin), "{{fn}} is not the correct trig function."),
           failif(ang == 53, "You need to convert the 53 degrees into radians."),
           insist(ang == 53 * pi / 180, "Do you have the angle right?"),
           passif(TRUE, "Good job!"))
```

Remember, it's up to the problem author to anticipate the kinds of wrong answers students will give and how to respond to them. Suppose, for instance, that after some experience with the problem, the instructor notes that many students are writing `225 * sin(53 * pi / 180)`, that is, multiplying by the square length of the hypothenuse. It would be nice to give specific feedback about this mistake. For instance,

```{r eval = FALSE}
if_matches(submission, .(fn)(..(arg)), 
           failif(TRUE), "Remember to take the length of the hypothenuse into account.")
if_matches(submission, .(hyp) * .(fn)(..(ang)), 
           failif(hyp == 225, "Use the length, not the square length!"),
           insist(hyp == 15, "What length are you using?"),
           insist(fn == quote(sin), "{{fn}} is not the correct trig function."),
           failif(ang == 53, "You need to convert the 53 degrees into radians."),
           insist(ang == 53 * pi / 180, "Do you have the angle right?"),
           passif(TRUE, "Good job!"))
```

The checking can be made more elaborate. For instance, suppose we want to warn about using `+` instead of `*` in the statement. This pattern will capture the function used in the place where we want multiplication:  `.(mult_fn)(.(hyp), .(fn)(..(ang)))`. With this pattern, we might include a test like `` failif(mult_fn != quote(`*`), "{{mult_fn}} is the wrong function.")``

### Taken out

One possibility would be "regular expressions" of the sort supported by `grep()`, `gsub()`, and so on. However, regular expressions do not know about the required syntax of R statements. For instance, "function arguments are enclosed in parentheses and multiple arguments are separated by commas."

The `redpen` package provides a pattern language that knows about R syntax. This allows us to specify patterns in a way that resembles R commands themselves. In particular, every pattern statement in `redpen` must be a syntactically correct R expression. As a trivial example, the pattern `15 * sin(53 * pi / 180)` describes an exact match to a specific correct answer. 



But there are other possible correct answers, e.g.

```{r}
submission_2 <- "theta <- 53 * pi/180; r <- 15; r*sin(theta)"
submission_3 <- "ang <- pi * (53 / 180); sin(ang) * 15"
```

Since it will be difficult to list every possible statement that produces a correct answer, it's important that the pattern language automatically handle trivial permutations of the correct command, unnecessary grouping parentheses, unconventional whitespace, etc.

To start, here's a pattern that stands for "the sine of something": `sin(.)`. The `.` inside the parentheses means "any single argument." 

To elaborate a bit, the pattern `sin(..(ang))` means "the sine of something, where the value of that something will be stored under the name `ang`." And going further, the pattern `.(fn)(..(ang))` means, "a function applied to a single argument, where the function name will be stored under `fn` and the value of the argument stored under `ang`." Note that `.(fn)(..(ang))` will *not* match `15 * sin(53 * pi / 180)`, because the pattern doesn't say anything about multiplication by 15.

## Fill in the blanks

A good pedagogical technique when introducing a subject is to start an exercise with part of the answer and ask students to fill in one or more blanks. This approach let's the instructor focus on one part of a command. As an example, consider this problem:

> Fill in the blanks in the following code to create a `ggplot2` command that will produce the following scatter plot with the `mtcars` data.    
    ```{r echo = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = hp, color = cyl)) +
  geom_point()
```
>
> There are four named blanks, for instance `..x..`. You'll have to replace all of them with the correct contents to generate the plot.
```{r eval = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = ..x.., y = ..y.., color = ..c..)) +
  ..geom..()
```

Let's suppose the student's submission, after filling in the blanks is
```{r}
submission <- "library(ggplot2); 
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = hp, y = mpg, color = cyl)) +
  geom_point()"
```

To check the submission, we need to create a pattern that will let us look up the student's values for each of the blanks, then compare these to the correct answer. Good news: We can use the prompt itself as a pattern.
```{r eval = FALSE}
check_blanks(submission,
             ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = ..x.., y = ..y.., color = ..c..)) + ..geom..(),
             passif(x == quote(mpg) && y == quote(hp) && 
                      c == quote(cyl) && geom == quote(geom_point),
                    "Good job! {{x}}, {{y}}, {{c}}, and {{geom}}"),
             noteif(x != quote(mpg), "{{x}} is not the variable on the horizontal axis."),
             noteif(y != quote(hp), "{{y}} is not the right variable for the vertical axis"),
             noteif(c != quote(cyl), "{{c}} is not the right variable to map to color."),
             noteif(geom != quote(geom_point), "{{geom}} is not the correct geom to make a scatter plot."),
             failif(TRUE, "Try again."))
```

It may seem a bit odd to use `..x..` as a blank. But R names are allowed to begin with `.` and cannot begin with `_`.

Sometimes you will want just one or two blanks and don't want to clutter up the template with named blanks. It's legal to use just dots for the blanks. Each blank must have a unique number of dots, and there must be eight or more dots. To refer to a blank in the tests, take away four dots to get the name of that blank. For example:

> Calculate the hypothenuse length C of a right triangle whose other edges are A and B.    
    ```{r eval = FALSE}
C <- .....(A^2 + B^2)
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
CHECK2 <- function(submission) check_blanks(submission, C <- ........(A^2 + B^2),
             passif(.... == quote(sqrt), "Right!"),
             insist(.... == quote(sqrt), "Think again. {{....}} is not the right function to use."))
```

The pattern in the checking statement can be the same as the prompt:
```{r eval = FALSE}
check_blanks(submission, C <- ........(A^2 + B^2),
             passif(.... == quote(sqrt), "Right!"),
             insist(.... == quote(sqrt), "Think again. {{....}} is not the right function to use."))
```

Let's try some different submissions:

- `C <- sqrt(A^2 + B^2)`
    ```{r eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
CHECK2("C <- sqrt(A^2 + B^2)")
```
- `C <- log(A^2 + B^2)`
    ```{r eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
CHECK2("C <- log(A^2 + B^2)")
```
- `C <- ........(A^2 + B^2)` that is, the dots were not replaced
    ```{r eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
CHECK2("C <- ........(A^2 + B^2)")
```
- `C <- sqrt(A + B)`
    ```{r eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
CHECK2("C <- sqrt(A + B)")
```

In the above we used names `x`, `y`, `c`, and `geom` to distinguish the blanks one from the other. 

## Checking submissions that throw an error

Sometimes students will submit code that throws an error, either at parse time or at run time. By default, learnr displays such errors in their native, somewhat cryptic format. 

`checkr` has some simple error-catching logic that tries to translate the native R messages into a friendlier format.  To turn this on, you need to add a `-code-check` chunk to each exercise.

* [ASIDE] I would rather that code checking be turned on or off at the document level, perhaps as a choice in `check_for_learnr()`. 
* [ASIDE] I would also rather that the evaluation of the exercise take place entirely in the checking function, rather than being run first by learnr and then handed off to the checking function.

For an exercise named `prob-1` the code check chunk will look like:

    ` ``{r prob-1-code-check, echo = FALSE}
    1 # there must be some content
    ```

If, when trying out your exercises, you find a parsing or run-time error that isn't captured by `checkr`, please submit an "issue" on the GitHub site so that we can add that into the system.


## OUTLINEY from here on

## Values vs expressions

`.(a)` versus `..(a)`

## Chains

## Patterns

- Name of an argument: `` rep(.(a), `..(nm)` = .(b)) ``. Note that the wild-card for the argument name needs to be placed in back-quotes. This is because `..(nm)` is not a valid argument name, but `` `..(nm)`
`` is.

## Use in tutorials

The check function for debugging, but don't use it in tutorial check chunks.



## Details

- using `quote(sin)` when comparing to a name
- at least one of the statements should match all of the patterns
- using `if_matches()` recursively to study a sub-pattern




What's the meaning of `.(fn)(...)`? NEED TO SAY it's a legal R expression, even if it isn't one that many experienced R users would recognize. `...` is a legal statement in R, although typically used only *within* functions. And `.(fn)` is a legal statement, which would usually be read as "the function named `.` being applied to the value of `fn`." The point here is that patterns must be legal R expressions, and `.(fn)(...)` satisfies this. But the components `...` and `.(fn)` in a pattern do not have their usual meaning. Instead, they follow the conventions of the `redpen` package.

As part of a pattern, `...` means any set of arguments: it's a wildcard which matches anything that might legally be used as arguments to a function. 

As part of a pattern, `.(fn)` means, "Give the name `fn` to whatever is being used in this role in the statement." And what part is that? In ordinary syntax, parentheses are used to indicate the application of a function to arguments. So `sin(...)` in a pattern means "evaluate the function `sin` and don't worry about what the specific argument or arguments are." In the pattern `.(fn)(...)` the marker `.(fn)` is in the position of `sin` in `sin(...)`. Thus, `.(fn)(...)` is a pattern that says, "I'm expecting a function being applied to some arguments. Use `fn` to represent the function itself."



The pattern is the part of the system that provides the flexibility for an author to define what standards should be satisfied by the submission. Let's elaborate on that.



WARNING TO THE READER: The patterns that follow may seem bizarre when you first encounter them. Rest assured, you'll have time to get to know them. And, even if they don't look like it, each pattern is a syntactically correct R statement.

Here are a few patterns that will be relevant to the rest of the example:

- `..(res)` -- the overall result of the submission, which will be available under the name `res`.
- `"+"(.(a), .(b))` -- the + function applied to two arguments, which we'll call `a` and `b`, which might themselves be expressions, as in `(2^1) + sqrt(9)`, where the arguments to + are `(2^1)` and `sqrt(9)`.
- `"+"(..(a), ..(b))` -- similar to be above, but if the two arguments happen to be expressions, `a` and `b` should stand for the *values* of their corresponding expressions. For instance matching the pattern to the submission `(2^1) + sqrt(9)` would result in `a` being 2 and `b` being 3.
- `.(fn)(.(a), .(b))` -- a function, which we'll call `fn`, being applied to arguments which we'll call `a` and `b`.
- `.(fn)(.)` -- a function applied to a single argument.
- `.(fn)(., ., ., ...)` a function applied to three or more arguments.

The facilities for implementing and applying these sorts of patterns are provided by the remarkable `redpen` package in conjunction with `rlang`.



## Multiple `if_matches` {#multiple_if_matches}

Introduce `check()` and multiple patterns.

## Expressions and `quote()` vs values

Consider this R command (which generates an error):
```{r error = TRUE}
a
```
Why the error? Because `a` does not have a value associated with it. But there's nothing wrong with `a` in itself; the statement would have worked if `a` had been bound to some value.

WHERE IS THIS GOING? 
- What `quote()` is doing in the examples. (Setting up the submission as an expression rather than the value of an expression.)
- Why you would need to use `quote()` in testing the expression itself. E.g. looking at the *name* of a function.
- The quoting goes on automatically when a string is passed as the submission.

```{r eval = FALSE}
submission <- "x <- 3; sin(x)"
# This will work. `fn` will be a symbol, as will `quote(sin)`.
if_matches(submission, .(fn)(.(arg)), passif(fn == quote(sin), "Function is {{fn}}, argument is {{arg}}"))
# This won't work. `fn` will be a symbol, but `sin` is a function, not a symbol.
if_matches(submission, .(fn)(.(arg)), passif(fn == sin, "Function is {{fn}}, argument is {{arg}}"))
# Back to working again. With the double dots, `fn` will be the value that the name "sin" points to. In this case, that will be the function `sin()`. 
if_matches(submission, ..(fn)(.(arg)), passif(fn == sin, "Function is {{fn}}, argument is {{arg}}"))
# The funny `.Primitive("sin")` reflects that the function `sin` is something called a "primitive," as opposed to the kind of thing like `function(x) x^2`. This will certainly be confusing as a message to students, so better to use comparison of the very first form, where the single-dot pattern is used and compared to `quote(sin)`.

```
## Tips on patterns and tests

- Patterns are raw R statements, for instance 
- Assignment-to has a pattern `` `<-`(x, ...) ``
    - If you want to allow assignment to any of several names, try `` `<-`(.(nm), ...) `` as the pattern and `nm == quote(x) || nm == quote(X)` as the test:
    ```{r eval = FALSE}
    if_matches(quote(x <- 3 + 2), `<-`(.(nm), ..(val)), 
               passif(nm == quote(X) || nm == quote(x), "{{nm}} was assigned the value {{val}}"))
    ```
    - Notice that the pattern has a single dot (`.(nm)`) for the assigned-to part of pattern. Similarly, the value to which it's being compared is in `quote()`, as appropriate for matching a language-name object.
- Distinguish between `.(a)` and `..(a)`. Suppose you want to check which trigonometric function has been used in a command like `quote(cos(x))`. An appropriate pattern would be `.(fn)(...)`, like this:
```{r eval = FALSE}
submission <- quote({x <- pi; cos(x)})
pattern <- quote(.(fn)(.(var))) # will have to unquote
if_matches(submission, !!pattern, passif(TRUE, "Found match"))
if_matches(submission, .(fn)(.(var)),
           passif(fn == quote(cos) && var == quote(x), "Right. The function is {{fn}} on variable {{var}}."))
```

## Taken out




To help meet the demand for R-related training, various *interactive tutorial systems* have been developed. These include [Swirl](http://swirlstats.com/), [DataComp.com](http://DataCamp.com), and the Shiny-based system introduced by RStudio: [`learnr`](http://github.com/rstudio/learnr). In each of these systems, a problem is posed to the student, who has an opportunity to construct R commands as a solution. The R commands are then passed to an evaluation system.



Readers may also want to check out the system for *[submission correctness tests](https://www.datacamp.com/community/blog/submission-correctness-testing-in-datacamp-datacamp-part-i#gs.vuTG8Xw)* provided by DataCamp.
